Solution:

The correct solution is to include the first element in the iteration.

So for max.c and Max.java:
- for (int i=n-2; i>0; i--)
+for (int i=n-2; i>=0; i--)

For max.py:
- for i in range(n-2, 0, -1):
+ for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):

The test cases added should be an array for which the maximum element is in the first position.


Marking scheme:
- 6 points to everyone who successfully opened a PR
- 2 points for the correct fix
- 2 points for a correct test: 1 point for a correct array, and 1 point for adding the correct assert
